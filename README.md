Advent of Code 2021 - A proof of how bad a programmer I am 

---
hey, after a few challenges, I just realized this game requires too many advanced English reading skills. Each challenge is a ridiculously long paragraph, which describes an unreal context. To be honest, I'm too lazy to figure it out. I rather tackle leetcode, which has a lot challenges in the developer's reality realm.
Just simply gave up to save my time :D
